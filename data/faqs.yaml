- Q: Why does my formula show incorrectly?
  A: |
    Formulas are made of mostly symbols, KSO is not able to carry the copyrighted fonts necessary to show these symbols,
    however you can get the fonts yourself <a href="/download/fonts">here</a>.

- Q: Do you have plans to provide 64-bit packages in the future?
  A: |
    Yes, we plan to provide x64 support. 
    However our code is ported from windows using the old COM style so it's hard to support x64. 
    We hope to have a x64-version by the end of the year. But it's hard predict exactly when we will be finished.. 
    <a href="http://wps-community.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=66">This post</a> is the latest news about the x64 version.
