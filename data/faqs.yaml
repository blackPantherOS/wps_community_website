- Q: Do you have any roadmap or plans to provide 64-bit packages in near future?
  A: |
    Yes, we have plan to provide x64 support.
    But out code is ported from windows, and using old com style.
    It's hard to support x64.
    We hope x64-version could run at the end of the year.
    But clear time is hard to expect.
